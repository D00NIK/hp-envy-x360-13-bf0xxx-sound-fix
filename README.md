# This is now archived thanks to cirrus team, finally fixing this. I believe it was added in 6.8 Kernel, but it for sure works with 6.9 one :)

Just a simple patch for the 6.7.2 kernel, I wrote a blog post [here](https://dmpk.xyz/blog/hp-envy-x360-sound-fix/) or [here raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D00NIK/dominikpakula-xyz/b35df0738126432760bebf1b41d244d89639a2ed/content/blog/hp-envy-x360-sound-fix/index.md).
